# Prioriti

**Prioriti** is a simple, card-style reminder app built with **SwiftUI**.  
This is an ongoing project I’m using to learn Swift and iOS development through hands-on exploration of app architecture, SwiftUI components, state management, and system features like local notifications.

---

## Features

- Add new reminders with title and time
- Swipe to delete reminders
- Local notifications when reminders are due
- Overdue reminders visually highlighted
- Adaptive light/dark mode styling

---

## In Progress

This project is actively evolving as I learn more about:
- SwiftUI best practices
- MVP architecture
- Data persistence with UserDefaults and Core Data
- Unit testing and UI testing
- App Store distribution

## Screenshots (coming soon)

## Why I'm Building This

I'm using **Prioriti** as a playground to apply SwiftUI concepts in a real-world context. It's helping me understand the iOS ecosystem while building something functional and meaningful.
