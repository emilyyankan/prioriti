# Prioriti

**Prioriti** is a simple reminder app built with **SwiftUI**.  
This is an ongoing project Iâ€™m using to learn Swift and iOS development through hands-on exploration of app architecture, SwiftUI components, state management, and system features like local notifications.

## Features

- Add new reminders with title and time
- Swipe to delete reminders
- Local notifications when reminders are due
- Overdue reminders visually highlighted

## In Progress

This project is actively evolving as I learn more about:
- SwiftUI best practices
- MVP architecture
- Data persistence with UserDefaults and Core Data
- Unit testing and UI testing
- App Store distribution
